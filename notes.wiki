= refactor = 
  - add VulkanBuffers to model itself ( one for vertex data and one for index data )

@vulkan notes:
  
  Semaphores-> are used for GPU-GPU synchronazation
  Fences-> are used for CPU-GPU synchronazation

  vkQueueSubmit(..) -> submit command buffer to a queue
      if fence is set, will signal the fence once all submited command buffers h ave completed the 
      operations.

  vkWaitForFences(..) -> wait for the fence/fences to signal that command buffer has finished
  executing.

@renderer notes:
  
  MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT -> how many frames should be processed concurently?
    -each frame should have its own set of semaphores.
    -we keep track of the frame with the variable [ m_currentFrame ].
